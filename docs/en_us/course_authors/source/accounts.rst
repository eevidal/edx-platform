EdX Edge_ is the site where edX partners can create courses with Studio, then test courses in the edX Learning Management System.

EdX Edge_ is also used to host SPOCs, or Small Private Online Courses.

Visually and functionally, edX Edge is the same as edX.org_. 
However, on Edge you can freely publish courses.  

There is no course catalog on Edge and students will not find your course. You must explicitly invite students to participate in your course.

Courses on Edge are not published on edX.org. 

.. note:: All course data and accounts on Edge_ and edX.org_ are separate. You must go through the registration processes on both sites.
